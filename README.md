# Ecommerce Applications
## Milestone 1: Project Overview
1. **Authentication:**
   - User login, signup, and logout functionalities.

2. **Product image:**
   - Display of all product images with detailed information.

3. **Orders page:**
   - A dedicated page for viewing user-specific orders.
   
4. **Payment gateway:**
   - Seamless integration with a payment gateway for processing transactions.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page.

## Overview
In this milestone, I successfully set up both the frontend and backend of the project. The objective was to create a robust structure for the application that includes a login page on the frontend and establish a backend setup for handling requests. 

### Frontend Setup:
1. **Vite**: Used Vite as the build tool for the frontend, as it provides fast development and efficient bundling.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling. The utility-first approach allows for rapid styling and better maintainability.
3. **Login Page**: Created a login page that allows users to input credentials, with basic form validation. The page is styled using Tailwind's pre-defined utility classes to ensure a responsive and modern design.

### Backend Setup:
1. **Express**: Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests, with routing configured for the login functionality.
2. **MongoDB (via Mongoose)**: Integrated MongoDB as the database for storing user information. Used Mongoose to interact with the database in an organized way.
3. **dotenv**: Installed and configured the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables securely for sensitive information like database connection strings and JWT secret keys.

## Achievements:
- **Frontend**: Completed a basic yet functional login page using React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Configured the backend with Express, Mongoose, and dotenv to handle API requests and manage environment configurations.
- **User Authentication**: Set up the basic structure for future user authentication endpoints (e.g., login and registration).


# Ecommerce Follow Along Project

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, I have successfully set up the backend of the ecommerce application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized the backend code into controllers, models, routes, middleware, and utils folders.
2. **Server Setup**: Configured an Express server to listen on port 5000 and handle API requests.
3. **MongoDB Integration**: Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose to store and manage item data.
4. **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling to catch errors and provide meaningful messages.

The Backend is now capable of performing basic CRUD operations on items.
