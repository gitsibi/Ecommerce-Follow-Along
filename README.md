4. **Payment gateway:**
   - Seamless integration with a payment gateway for processing transactions.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page.

## Overview
In this milestone, I successfully set up both the frontend and backend of the project. The objective was to create a robust structure for the application that includes a login page on the frontend and establish a backend setup for handling requests. 

### Frontend Setup:
1. **Vite**: Used Vite as the build tool for the frontend, as it provides fast development and efficient bundling.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling. The utility-first approach allows for rapid styling and better maintainability.
3. **Login Page**: Created a login page that allows users to input credentials, with basic form validation. The page is styled using Tailwind's pre-defined utility classes to ensure a responsive and modern design.

### Backend Setup:
1. **Express**: Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests, with routing configured for the login functionality.
2. **MongoDB (via Mongoose)**: Integrated MongoDB as the database for storing user information. Used Mongoose to interact with the database in an organized way.
3. **dotenv**: Installed and configured the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables securely for sensitive information like database connection strings and JWT secret keys.

## Achievements:
- **Frontend**: Completed a basic yet functional login page using React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Configured the backend with Express, Mongoose, and dotenv to handle API requests and manage environment configurations.
- **User Authentication**: Set up the basic structure for future user authentication endpoints (e.g., login and registration).
